# MRThreshold

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of MRThreshold is to simulate microrandomized trials subject to a capacity constrain.

## Installation

You can install the development version of MRThreshold from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("vsritter/MRThreshold")
```

## Example

To simulate the trajectory of 100 patients subject to a capacity of 5 (see the example of a model specification for the *4T Sustainnability Microrandomized* Trial in the package website)

```{r example}
library(MRThreshold)

RNGkind("L'Ecuyer-CMRG")
set.seed(365342)

sim_list <- sim_microrand(N = 100, capacity = 5)
sim_list
```
